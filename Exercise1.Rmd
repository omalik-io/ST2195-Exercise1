### Student ID: 106604

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for practicing basic R data types, which is part of the ST2195 course at UOL and BIBF.
Please answer the following questions by writing proper R code, and upload the completed file to a GitHub repository shared with your teacher (Github id heshaaam\@gmail.com).

Prior to running the commands in R, try to figure out what you expect the result to be.You should then verify that this will indeed be the qresult by running the command in an R session. In case there is a discrepency between your expectations and the actual output make sure you understand why before you move forward. If you can not figure out how to, or which command to run you can ask your instructor or discuss the issue in class.

Also note that in many cases there multiple solutions that solve the problem equally well.

We do recommend to write all code in a R markdown document in R-studio as that will at the end of the course be your own R tutorial with comments and code solutions.

## Cleaning Your Environment

Open R-studio and make sure to set your working directory. Double check that you do not have stored objects in your current session with the following command. This will list all objects that you have in your current R session.

```{r}
ls()
```

In case you have objects that you want to remove from the current session you can do so with the rm function. NB! This command will remove all objects available in your current session.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Basic Data Types in R

1. Create variables var1 and var2 and initialize them with two integers of choice.
Please place your answer in the available code chunks below the question.

```{r}
var1 <- as.integer(315)
var2 <- 513L
```

2. Add the two variables and save them as a new variable named var3 and print the result.

```{r}
var3 <- var1 + var2
print(var3)
```

3. Check the class, mode, and type for var1, var2, var3 and $\pi$ (is found under the variable name pi in R)

```{r}
cat("var1 >>> Class:",class(var1),"| Storage Mode:", storage.mode(var1), "| Type:",typeof(var1),"\n")
cat("var2 >>> Class:",class(var2),"| Storage Mode:", storage.mode(var2), "| Type:",typeof(var2),"\n")
cat("var3 >>> Class:",class(var3),"| Storage Mode:", storage.mode(var3), "| Type:",typeof(var3),"\n")
cat("  pi >>> Class:",class(pi),"| Storage Mode:", storage.mode(pi), " | Type:",typeof(pi),"\n")
```

4. Create two character variables text1 and text2 containing any text of choice. Check mode, class, and type of the first one.

```{r}
text1 <- "They are my bulwark against the Terror"
text2 <- "And They Shall Know No Fear"

cat("text1 >>> Class:",class(text1),"| Storage Mode:", storage.mode(text1), "| Type:",typeof(text1),"\n")
```

Add var1 from above to text1 and report the result.

```{r}
paste(c(var3,text1), collapse = " ")
print("Note: the paste() function force coerces any number to character so that it's easily added to string\n")
```

5. Coerce or cast (force data type) var3 to integer, cast an integer variable to double, cast a string to a double.

```{r}
as.integer(var3)
as.double(var2)
as.double(text1)
```

6. Use the floor and ceiling functions to calculate the floor and ceiling of $\pi$.
Check whether the floor of $\pi$ is an integer?

```{r}
piFloor <- floor(pi)
piCeiling <- ceiling(pi) 
cat("The Floor and Ceiling results for pi are",piFloor,"and",piCeiling,"respectively.\n")
cat("The floor of pi's type is", typeof(piFloor),"\n")
```

7. Convert the ‘3.56437’ string as number.

```{r}
text3 <- "3.56437"
var4 <- as.numeric(text3)
```

8. Infinity (i.e. $\infty$) is written in R as \\inf . Calculate $\infty$ divided by $-\infty$.

```{r}
is.infinite(Inf)
infin <- Inf / -Inf
print(infin)
```

9. Create two freely chosen complex numbers.
```{r}
comp1 <- 873i-9
comp2 <- -32.4i
```


* Check that they are complex indeed.
```{r}
cat("Check if the first is a complex number: ",is.complex(comp1),"\n")
cat("Check if the second is a complex number: ",is.complex(comp2),"\n")
```


* Add, multiply and divide one by another.
```{r}
cadd <- comp1+comp2
cmult <- comp1*comp2
cdiv <- comp2/comp1
cat("Complex Addition:",cadd,"\nComplex Multiplication:",cmult,"\nComplex Division:",cdiv,"\n")
```


* Add an integer to their sum.
```{r}
cadd <- cadd+933
print(cadd)
```

10. Multiply a logical TRUE by a logical FALSE. 

Raise the logical TRUE to the 7-th power.

```{r}
a <- TRUE
b <- FALSE

cat("The result of multiplying the two 'logicals' is",(a*b),". This is effectively the 'AND' operator in Logic.\n")

a^7
```

11. Create two character variables containing two verses of your favorite song.

* concatenate the two variables,

* paste the variables with ‘*’ as separator.

* find if ‘and’ occurs in the second line,

* substitute a word for another,

* extract substring starting at the 5th character and 5 characters long.

```{r}
verse1 <- "Well it's flooding down in Texas"
verse2 <- "all of the telephone lines are down"

catverses1 <- paste(verse1, verse2)
print(catverses1)

catverses2 <- paste(verse1, verse2,sep = "*")
print(catverses2)

library(stringr) 
cat("Does the word 'and' appear in the second verse? - ",str_detect(verse2, "and"),"\n")

print(sub("Texas", "Jidhafs", verse1)) 

subverse <- substr(catverses1, 5, 9)
print(subverse)


```
